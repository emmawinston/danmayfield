				<h2>Dan Mayfield - Head of iFOUNDSOUND / Facilitator</h2>

				<p>iFOUNDSOUND was founded by Dan who is a professional musician currently living in London.  He spent his childhood growing up in rural Lincolnshire where he developed a fondness for the quietude of the countryside. Whilst there he went on to study Sound Engineering and Music Technology and later moved to London to study Commercial Music at the University of Westminster.  Dan plays the violin and has performed at music venues and festivals over Europe and recorded albums both playing his own music and with other artists as a session musician.  Dan also has 9 years experience working with adults and children on the autistic spectrum.</p>
